Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas.  
I am in the software development business for more than 25 years.  
I've done a lot of different things: 
* C++ on Windows (3.x, 95, NT, etc.)
* Command line and UI tools
* Novel netware modules
* Windows services
* Configuration tools for intruder detection systems
* Touchpanel UIs for intruder detection systems in .Net, WinForms and WPF
* Tools for software license compliance in .Net and Python
* Containerized application on AWS

Currently I am working as a principal expert for software license compliance
for Siemens. Another name for the job would be leading an OSPO for a Siemens business unit.
